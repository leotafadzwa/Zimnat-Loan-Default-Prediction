# Zimnat Loan Default Prediction

## Overview
Giving loans is risky business. And the less you know about what loans will be paid, the harder it will be for you to manage that risk. Zimnat has provided a sample dataset of over 12,000 loans, many of them with money overdue. The challenge is to predict which loans will end in a missed payment, and which will not.
